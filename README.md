# audio-graph-editor

basically a fork of [finnp/streams-editor](https://github.com/finnp/streams-editor)
but instead of streams, we are modelling an audiograph of
nodes from the web audio api.

Most of the interesting things are happening in these three modules..
* [audiograph](https://www.npmjs.com/package/audiograph)
* [flowgraph](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flowgraph)
* [flowgraph-editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flowgraph-editor)
